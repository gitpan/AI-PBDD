PBDD version 0.01
=================

This module provides a Perl interface to the BuDDy 2.4 library for Binary Decision Diagrams. The interface is as close as possible to JBDD, a Java interface to the BuDDy and CUDD packages written by Arash Vahidi.

DEPENDENCIES

Before building the PBDD module, you must:
1) download the buddy-2.4 library from:
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/
2) build and install buddy-2.4 as follows:
      export CFLAGS='-fPIC -O2'
      export CXXFLAGS='-fPIC -O2'
      ./configure --prefix=/my/buddy/home --disable-shared
      make
      make install
   NOTE: /my/buddy/home stands for the directory where you unzipped buddy-2.4

INSTALLATION

First of all set the environment variable BUDDYPATH to the directory where you unzipped buddy-2.4, e.g.:
   export BUDDYPATH=/my/buddy/home

Then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
